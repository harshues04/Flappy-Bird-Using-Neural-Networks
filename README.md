### Flappy-Bird-Using-Neural-Networks
This project demonstrates the use of neural networks to train an AI agent to play the Flappy Bird game. The game is developed using the Pygame library, and the neural network models incorporate popular activation functions such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how deep learning can be used in game-based scenarios for teaching an agent to make decisions and improve over time. The Flappy Bird AI learns to avoid obstacles (pipes) by making precise jumps, mimicking the behavior of an expert player. 

 The bird is trained at three different speeds: 1x, 4x, and 16x, allowing for varied training scenarios and performance testing.
